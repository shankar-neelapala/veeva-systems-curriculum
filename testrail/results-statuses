Test results and Test Statuses
What are test results?
  Test results are the outcome of your testing cycle. In TestRail, each test result can include updates to test statuses and other test fields, comments, and attachments.
  Test statuses
  Comparing the test results with the expected results allows the tester to assign statuses to the tests.
  By default, each test has one of five different statuses that are signaled in TestRail by specific colors. 

•	Untested: By default, new tests have the status Untested. Once a test result has been added to a test, it can never receive the Untested status again.
•	Passed: A test is marked as Passed when a tester verified the test steps and their testing demonstrates that the functionality of the application matches the expected results.
•	Failed: A tester marks a test as Failed if one of the specified test steps resulted in an error or if the expected result differs from the actual test result.
•	Retest: If a developer or tester determines that a test should be tested again, they can mark the test as Retest (e.g., if a test originally failed and the developer fixed the problem, the developer can mark it to be retested).
•	Blocked: The Blocked status is used to signal that a test cannot be executed currently because of some external dependency (such as a bug that needs to be fixed before being able to complete the test). It is often used in combination with the Retest status.
