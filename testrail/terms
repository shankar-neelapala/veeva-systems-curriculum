Key terms in TestRail

1. Test Case
  Test cases are building blocks in testrail.
  A test case is consists of
  - Summary of the test case that means what you need to test
  - Descripton about how to run your tests which includes prerequisites, stpes, data and the result
  - Additional info. like priority, type, linked or reference 

2. Sectios and Subsections  
  Sectiona and Subscetions are like folders allowing you to organize the test cases in a heirarchial structure(tree)
  - Multiple test cases related to the login page are grouped together

3. Test Suite
  Test Suite is only find when we use mutliple test suites project type
  It gives you a additional layer of separation between the groups of test cases
  Each test suite is independent and not related to other suites within the project

4. Tests
  - When a test case is selected to be part of a test
    run, TestRail creates a test with a unique ID for
    that specific test run.
  - A Test (within a Test Run) is an instance of executing a Test Case (or multiple) to track actual results (pass/fail/blocked)
    against a specific build or configuration

5. Test Run
  A test run consists of tests for each test case that you add and it represents what you actually plan to test under a specific release, sprint or milestone

6. Results
  After executing the tests, the tester compares the executed outcome with the actual outcome and record their finding as the testing results

7. Test Plan
  When you need manage multiple test runs for a single release or milestione a test plan comes in handy
  Test plans allow you to create multiple test runs at once and group them for easier tracking. You can generate test runs for various configurations automatically




Project: The top-level container in TestRail for all testing activities related to a specific application or product.

Test Planning & Execution
  Test Run: A set of test cases selected from the repository to be executed within a specific cycle (e.g., a sprint or release).
  Test Plan: A higher-level container for managing multiple test runs, allowing for complex, parallel, or phased testing.
  Milestone: A way to organize test runs and plans around specific project goals, releases, or deadlines.
  FastTrack: A feature for quickly reviewing and updating the status of multiple tests in a run. 
Results & Statuses
  Test Status: The outcome of a test, usually: Passed, Failed, Blocked (cannot be tested due to bugs), or Retest.
  Untested: The default status for new tests that have not yet been executed.
  Add Result: The action of logging the outcome, comments, and defects for a test case. 
Integration & Reporting
  References (Refs): IDs used to link test cases to external requirements or user stories in tools like Jira.
  Defect: A bug linked to a failed test result, usually tracked in external systems.
  Reports: Built-in analytics for tracking test progress, coverage, and team productivity.
  TestRail API: A programming interface used to integrate automated tests and external tools with TestRail.
