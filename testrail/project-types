Projects 
  Projects are the main organizational unit in TestRail. The type of project you use will define how you organize and manage your test cases within that project

Types of projects in testrail

1. Single repository projects
  A single test suite (repository) is easy to manage and flexible enough for most projects with few concurrent versions.
  You will have a single area in which all of your test cases for that project are stored and you can use sections and subsections to organize your test cases
  You will have a single area in which all of your test cases for that project are stored and you can use sections and subsections to organize your test cases

2. Single repository with baseline support projects
  A single test suite (repository) gives you the additional option to create baselines to manage multiple branches of your test cases at the same time

3. Multiple Test Suites
  Projects with multiple test suites can be used to organize your test cases by functional areas and application modules on the test suite level.
  Each test suite can be organized into its own sections and subsections, like in a single repository-type project.

1. Single Repository
  Best For: Most projects needing simplicity and flexibility.
  How it Works: All test cases reside in one test suite, organized by sections and subsections.
  Benefit: Easy management and facilitates end-to-end testing within a single run. 

2. Single Repository with Baseline Support
  Best For: Managing multiple product versions or concurrent testing.
  How it Works: Starts with a master suite, then creates baselines (copies) for different versions, allowing parallel testing.
  Benefit: Version control for tests across different releases. 

3. Multiple Test Suites
  Best For: Large, functionally distinct test suites (e.g., Functional, Regression, Automation).
  How it Works: Divides tests into separate, distinct suites within the same project.
  Limitation: Test runs can only select cases from a single suite, not across multiple suites at once.
