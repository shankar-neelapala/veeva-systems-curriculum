Jira Automation
  •	Jira Automation is a built-in, no-code feature in Jira Cloud that lets users create "if-this-then-that" rules to automate repetitive tasks and
  streamline workflows, reducing manual effort and errors by using triggers (events), conditions (filters), and actions (tasks)
  •	These rules can be simple (like auto-assigning issues) or complex (like cross-project updates)


  •	Triggers
    o	The event that starts the rule (e.g., Issue Created, Field Value Changed, Due Date Passed).


  •	Conditions
    o	Filters that define when the rule should run (e.g., only for specific projects, issue types, or assignees).


  •	Actions
    o	The task Jira performs (e.g., Assign Issue, Send Slack Message, Transition Status, Add Comment, Create Sub-task)


Common Use Cases
  Auto-assigning issues to users with the least workload.
  Moving issues to a "Done" column when all sub-tasks are complete.
  Notifying Slack or specific users when a release is shipped.
  Automatically adding labels or components to issues.
