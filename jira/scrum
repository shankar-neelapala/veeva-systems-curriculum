What is Scrum in agile
  •	Scrum is an iterative Agile framework where work is delivered in fixed-length iterations called sprints
  •	Key Scrum Elements in Jira
    o	Product Backlog → List of all work items (stories, bugs, tasks)
    o	Sprint Backlog → Items selected for the current sprint
    o	Sprint Board → Visual board to track work status
  •	Sprint Planning in Jira
    o	Product Owner prioritizes backlog
    o	Team selects issues for the sprint
    o	Team estimates effort (story points or time)
    o	Sprint goal is defined
  •	Sprint Execution
    o	Developers move issues across statuses
    o	Jira updates progress automatically
    o	Burndown chart shows remaining work
  •	Sprint Completion
    o	Sprint Review → Demonstrate completed work
    o	Sprint Retrospective → Discuss improvements
    o	Sprint is closed in Jira
    
•	Story Points (Preferred in Scrum)
  o	Measure relative effort, not time
  o	Based on:
  o	Complexity
  o	Risk
  o	Uncertainty
  o	Uses Fibonacci scale: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
•	Example: login page – 2 points, payment integration – 8 points
