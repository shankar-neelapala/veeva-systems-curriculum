Test Execution
  •	Manages the running of tests, creating instances (Test Runs) and tracking results (Pass/Fail/Blocked).
  •	For each step or iteration, logging defects if needed, and tracking progress via status updates and reports.
  •	Each run creates a "Test Run" capturing results within the Test Execution's context for a specific environment and version.


In Xray for Jira, the Test Execution is a specific Jira issue type used to group Tests for a particular run, track their progress (pass/fail/blocked), 
and manage the overall testing cycle within an environment, functioning like a test cycle or iteration to oversee execution of selected Test Cases or Test Sets

Key Characteristics of a Test Execution:
  Aggregates Tests: It brings together a collection of Test issues (or Test Sets) you want to execute together for a specific purpose (e.g., Sprint 1, Regression Cycle).
  Tracks Progress: Provides an overall status (Passed, Failed, Blocked, etc.) as individual tests within it are run.
  Manages Execution: Allows you to assign tests to specific testers and track results within a target environment.
  Generates Test Runs: Each time a Test is executed from a Test Execution, a unique "Test Run" is created, maintaining execution history.
