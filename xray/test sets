Test Set

In Xray for Jira, a Test Set is a specific Jira issue type used to group multiple Test Cases (also Xray issue types) into a logical suite, enabling collective
execution, organization by sprint/feature, and easier management, functioning like a folder or tag for tests, unlike the hierarchical Test Repository.

Key Characteristics & Purpose
  Grouping: Gathers multiple tests (Test Cases) for a common purpose (e.g., regression, sprint-specific tests).
  Execution: Allows running many tests at once, streamlining execution cycles.
  Organization: Helps structure tests by criteria like sprints, releases, or functionalities, separate from the Test Repository's tree structure.
  Flexibility: A single Test Case can belong to multiple Test Sets, and Test Sets can span projects.
  Traceability: Can link to User Stories or Epics, leveraging Jira's core features.
