Precondition
  •	It defines prerequisite condition or data needed to run a test case
  •	Reusable across tests
  •	For example, to check login credential of a news app, the user must install the app and registered with the app 
  
In Xray for Jira, a Precondition is a specific issue type used to define prerequisites that must be met before a test case can run, ensuring reusability
by allowing them to be created once and linked to multiple tests (e.g., "user is logged in").

Preconditions are independent entities, managed like other Jira issues (with summaries, details, history), and their fulfillment status (To Do, In Progress,
Completed) can be tracked during execution, promoting test setup consistency.
